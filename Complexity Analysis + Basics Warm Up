DSA learing series of CodeChef is a begineer level very very long contest!!!!! Actually Its for learning purpose,SO publishing  tutorial during contest is allowed.
There are many topics....the first one is "Complexity Analysis + Basics Warm Up". There are 9 problems.I tried to solve all....at least I become successful.
I solved 8 problems by fully myself,for the last one I have to see others code.But I write code by my idea.
I solved all by C++14.



The first problem is: https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/TEST
The problem says to take input(1 or 2 digits number) and print them until the number 42 is found,In my code I use "return 0" to terminate.
We have to print newline after each number.
My solution is here...https://ideone.com/jqK2mK
The first one is very easy.Now come to the second one....



The Second problem is: https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/FLOW007
The problem says to reverse a number.Suppose a number is 12345,then we have to print 54321.We can easily do it by string reverse function.
If we use the function,We get WA(wrong answer) because,for 3400 the output will be 0043.But our standard output is 43.So wew have to use another function,
that is string stream.I didn't use that string stream class before that...String Stream transfer a string into number.
If you don't understand see my solution...

The second problem can be solved by another way(actually many ways).



Now come to the 3rd problem.
The third problem is: https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/LAPIN
The name of the problem is very interesting.Lapindrome....!Suppose we have a string.we have to devide the string in two equal parts.
If the elements of those two parts are sameand their frequency of every element is same ,the string is lapindrome.
So abab is a lapindrome.
"abba" is also a lapindrome(the first part is "ab" and the second part is "ba",there are two characters in both part...their frequency are same too...)
So,abbaab is not a lapindrome.....
What if the length of the string is ODD??? We have to skip the middle character...
So,Let the string is "apspa",tength is 5.The middle character is "s",after skipping this,the string is "appa",that is a Lapindrome.
If you don't understand see the code...!

The forth problem is:https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/ZCO14003
Read the problem first...suppose there are 5 people,They are interested to buy your app.
They can only buy the app iff the prize of the app is less than or equal to their ability(their money).
Suppose their ability is 65,21,40,33,3.You have to find out when the profit is maximum?
You have to print the maximum profit.
if you sell the app at price 65,only one people can buy it.So the maximum profit is: 65 X 1 = 65.
if the price of the app is 40,The maximum profit is: 40 X 2 = 80.(2 people can buy the app)
if the price of the app is 33,The maximum profit is: 33 X 3 = 99.(3 people can buy the app)
if the price of the app is 21,The maximum profit is: 21 X 4 = 84.(4 people can buy the app)
if the price of the app is 3,The maximum profit is :3 X 5 = 15.(5 people can buy the app)
So the maximum profit is 99.

The fifth problem is :https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/CARVANS
In this problem we have to find how many cars can go to its maximum spreed...read the problem first.
For each case the first car can run by its maximum spreed.and if x>y<z,than the car y can run in its maximum spreed.
my code: https://ideone.com/RLGUVD


The sixth problem is :https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/FCTRL
It takes more than 2 hours to solve the problem though it is very easy.
We have to calculate the  trailing zeros of n!.
if n==5 we get 1 trailing Zero...
if n==10 we get 2  trailing zero...
....
....
if n==25 we get 6  trailing zero...
....
....
I don't want to share more information....to understand how the  trailing zero increases,
you can visit...https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/factorials.php
My code is:https://ideone.com/9UhyGL



The seventh problem is:https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/CONFLIP
My algorithm is:
   if (I = HEAD(1) and Q=HEAD(1)) or (I=Tail(2) and Q=Tail(2))result=n/2;
   else result = n-(n/2)
we can implement it more easily....
if(I == Q) result=n/2;
else result =n-(n/2);
My code:https://ideone.com/64Km7O


The eight number problem is:https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/LADDU
To solve the problem one need to know about just if,if...else...etc.But I get TLE once time and WA also..!So be careful in using loop
My code is:https://ideone.com/b2ke1F


The last problem is:https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/MULTHREE
The problem gives us first two digits of a number,and also the number of digits....We have to find out if the number is divisible by 3 or not...
If a number is divisible by 3,then the summation of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3.So we have to find the other digits of the number...

Thats all....!Thanks for Reading....!
